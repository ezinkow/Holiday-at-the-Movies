# User Story
Everyone loves watching holiday movies! Wouldn't it be great if someone could recommend you not one, but a whole list of holiday movies based on a specific date?
First, the user enters any date of their choosing
The user is then asked to choose one of the presented holidays that are closest to that date
Then the user picks a genre
The application will produce a list of movies related to that holiday along with a description and rating


# Purpose of Application
Introducing Holiday at the Movies: An application that gives you a list of movies based on the holidays that are closest to the date that is entered.

# Distrubution of work
<br> Elan - HTML, AJAX Calls, objects </br>
<br> Jessica - CSS, on-click, correcting bugs  </br>
<br> Jacob -  design layout, on-clicks, perfecting the communication between APIs </br>
<br> Claudia - HTML, concept, powerpoint </br>


# jQuery/ vanilla JavaScript tools used within the application
<br> On click </br>
<br> Drop downs </br>
<br> Objects </br>
<br> Ajax calls for apis (the movie db, calendarfic, ombd) </br>
<br> If/else statements </br>
<br> Prevent default </br>
<br> Hide/show on specific html elements </br>

# Our experience
<br> We underestimated the amount of holidays there are in the US, but were able to narrow it down. </br> 
<br> With using three seperate APIs, communication between the three was tricky to perfect. </br>
<br> The different APIs some using keywords, but the others uses ID's, so we converted ID's to genres. </br>

# Directions for future development
<br> Add an option for movie to specify its rating.</br>
<br> Links to a trailer for each movie. </br>
